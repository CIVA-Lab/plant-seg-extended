# UNet3D Lateral Root Primordia Cell Boundries

A a variant of 3D U-Net trained to predict the cell boundaries in lightsheet stacks of Arabidopsis lateral root primordia.
Voxel size: (0.25x0.1625x0.1625Âµm^3) (ZYX). 

Trained on 3D lightsheet image stacks published [here](https://elifesciences.org/articles/57613).
